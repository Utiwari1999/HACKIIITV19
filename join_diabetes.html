                        I'm abit confused.... 6 months ago I was told after a smear test that I had abnormal cells
                         to them have a biopsy taken to find out I had CIN1... 6 months later I go for a follow up smear
                         test and the colposcopy surgeon then says he's going to take another biopsy... why would this be?

                    CIN 1 is often known as low grade changes. Usually these return back to normal by themselves
                     and no treatment is needed. However you do need further screening tests or colposcopies to
                      check the cells have improved.
