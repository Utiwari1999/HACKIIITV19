                Suppose a person is suffering from a particular disease so if he gets a recommendation from the person who has already suffered and found a solution to cure it, it would be beneficial. And by this way the person can get the best solution to solve his problem.
            </p>
            <p>To solve this problem we will be creating a community of people suffering from same disease or suffered from the same disese in past. Where different patients suffering from same disease can take help from other people solve the same problem who were facing the same problem.Like all the cancer patients will be having a community where one patient suffering from cancer and found a solution can help other patients having a cancer. And in this platform patients can also take recoomendation from a doctor when ever they need.
            </p>
            <p>
                    And this platform will also be making use of left over medicines, health products of cured patients who wish to donate medicines to other patients having same problem. There will be a network of medical stores where one can donate their medicines which are of no use to them. And later these medicines can be provided to the people who need them free of cost.
